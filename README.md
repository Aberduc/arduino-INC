# arduino-INC

A simple C program for an arduino. We had a thermal captor, 3 leds, 2 lasers and a motor.
The goal was to activate the lasers and the motor whenever the temperature changed too much.

The 3 leds were there to display information : 
  - Led 1 is active when the device is working
  - Led 2 when an hornet has been detected, ie when the temperature changed too much.
  - Led 3 when the hornet has been handled
  
  
the button is there to restart the hornet counter.
